# Workflow
Our first goal/feature was to create a chronometer which is an instrument for measuring time.
We set our chronometer that in every 10 seconds there will be a notification that will pop up which is "Bing!".
When the "Bing!" pops up it will then go back from 0 and then start counting again until it reach another 10 seconds.
Next we added a "start button" feature in order for the application to work.
Next we added a "pause button" feature that will enable the clock to stop counting.
We set the "pause button" feature so that everytime you pause the program and click the "start button" it will start counting on the time where you paused it.
Lastly, we added a "reset button" feature that will return the time back to 0 and then start counting again until it reach 10 seconds.
